        ## üê¶ Biogeography and Evolution of Peninsular Indian Birds

        ![Biogeography of birds](/research/biogeography.jpg)

        This project aims to understand how topography and climate influence taxonomic and genomic diversity in peninsular Indian birds.

        - **Focus:** Diversity patterns, gene flow, and niche differentiation  
        - **Tools:** Whole genome sequencing, landscape genomics, phylogenetics  
        - **Duration:** 2023‚Äìpresent

        ## üå≤ Forest Fragmentation and Avian Community Structure

        ![Forest fragmentation](/research/fragmentation.jpg)

        We study how forest fragmentation impacts species interactions, community composition, and ecological resilience.

        - **Study area:** Western Ghats, India  
        - **Data sources:** Point counts, remote sensing, and acoustic monitoring  
        - **Collaborators:** [Name Lab/PI], [Institution]

        ## üåç Climate Change and Bird Distribution Shifts

        ![Birds and climate](/research/climate.jpg)

        This project explores past and future distribution shifts of forest birds under changing climate regimes.

        - **Methods:** Ecological niche modeling, paleoclimate projections  
        - **Outputs:** Species distribution maps, predictive scenarios  
        - **Publications:** [Link to papers or preprints]
