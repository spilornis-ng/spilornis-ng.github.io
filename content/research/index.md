        ## Biogeography and Evolution of Peninsular Indian Birds

        ![Biogeography of birds](/research/biogeography.jpg)

        This project aims to understand how topography and climate influence diversity and genomic variation in peninsular Indian birds. Combining distributional range maps of resident breeding forest birds, and [latest](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409658122) phylogenetic tree for birds of the world, the study quantifies the patterns in species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and endemism and uses spatial autoregressive models to understand the relative importance of historic and contemporary climate, and topography.

        - **Focus:** Diversity patterns, genomic variation, demographic history  
        - **Approach:** Population genomics, Phylogenomics  
        - **Duration:** 2019â€“present
        - **Publications:** Goyal, N., Sharma, A., Jagati, V., Herur, A., Arunima, J., Gopal, A., Joshi, J., and Robin, V.V. 2025. Spatial patterns of diversity in forest birds of peninsular India. [[Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.650994v1)]
