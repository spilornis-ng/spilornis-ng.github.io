## Biogeography and Evolution of Peninsular Indian Birds

![Biogeography of birds](images/biogeography.jpg)

This project aims to understand how topography and climate influence diversity and genomic variation in peninsular Indian birds.

- **Focus:** Diversity patterns, Genomic variation, Demographic history  
- **Approach:** population genomics, phylogenetics  
- **Duration:** 2019‚Äìpresent

## üå≤ Forest Fragmentation and Avian Community Structure

![Forest fragmentation](images/fragmentation.jpg)

We study how forest fragmentation impacts species interactions, community composition, and ecological resilience.

- **Study area:** Western Ghats, India  
- **Data sources:** Point counts, remote sensing, and acoustic monitoring  
- **Collaborators:** [Name Lab/PI], [Institution]

## üåç Climate Change and Bird Distribution Shifts

![Birds and climate](images/climate.jpg)

This project explores past and future distribution shifts of forest birds under changing climate regimes.

- **Methods:** Ecological niche modeling, paleoclimate projections  
- **Outputs:** Species distribution maps, predictive scenarios  
- **Publications:** [Link to papers or preprints]
